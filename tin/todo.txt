- perms in DB layer? how to deal with custom methods?
- perms callable from templates
    - could possibly hack it up in JS...
- all builtins start w/_ (ie change delete)
- restart server on template change
- unify DB methods
- all tin.obj urls to Urls.js
- remove inline form razzamatazz
- add _user var to all pages
